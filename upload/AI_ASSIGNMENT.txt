3.2:
 Your goal is to navigate a robot out of a maze. The robot starts in the center of the maze facing north. You can turn the robot to face north, east, south, or west. You can direct the
robot to move forward a certain distance, although it will stop before hitting a wall.
a. Formulate this problem. How large is the state space?
b. In navigating a maze, the only place we need to turn is at the intersection of two or
more corridors. Reformulate this problem using this observation. How large is the state
space now?
c. From each point in the maze, we can move in any of the four directions until we reach a
turning point, and this is the only action we need to do. Reformulate the problem using
these actions. Do we need to keep track of the robot’s orientation now?
d. In our initial description of the problem we already abstracted from the real world,
restricting actions and removing details. List three such simplifications we made.

ANS:
a. The problem can be formulated as a search problem where the goal is to find a path from the starting point to the exit of the maze. The state space consists of all possible positions and orientations of the robot in the maze. Since the robot can be at any position in the maze and facing any direction (north, east, south, or west), the state space size depends on the size of the maze. If the maze has M rows and N columns, the state space would be M x N x 4 (4 orientations).

b. By considering only the intersections of corridors as the places where the robot needs to turn, we can simplify the problem. Now the state space consists only of the positions of the robot at the intersections. If there are K intersections in the maze, the state space size would be K.

c. If we consider that we can move from any point in the maze to the next turning point in any of the four directions, the problem can be further simplified. In this case, we don't need to keep track of the robot's orientation because it only moves forward until it reaches a turning point. The state space consists only of the positions of the robot at the turning points.

d. Three simplifications made in the initial description of the problem are:

1-We assume the maze is a grid structure where the robot can only move horizontally or vertically. In reality, mazes can have more complex layouts with diagonal paths or obstacles.

2-We assume the robot can only move forward a certain distance and stop before hitting a wall. In reality, robots might have different movement capabilities, such as the ability to rotate or move in smaller increments.

3-We assume the robot knows the layout of the maze and can make informed decisions about its actions. In reality, robots might need to use sensors or mapping algorithms to explore and navigate unknown mazes.

3.20: 
Consider the vacuum-world problem defined in Figure 2.2.
a. Which of the algorithms defined in this chapter would be appropriate for this problem?
Should the algorithm use tree search or graph search?
b. Apply your chosen algorithm to compute an optimal sequence of actions for a 3 × 3
world whose initial state has dirt in the three top squares and the agent in the center. 
c. Construct a search agent for the vacuum world, and evaluate its performance in a set of
3 × 3 worlds with probability 0.2 of dirt in each square. Include the search cost as well
as path cost in the performance measure, using a reasonable exchange rate.
d. Compare your best search agent with a simple randomized reflex agent that sucks if
there is dirt and otherwise moves randomly.
e. Consider what would happen if the world were enlarged to n × n. How does the performance of the search agent and of the reflex agent vary with n?

ANS:

a. The appropriate algorithms for the vacuum-world problem are uninformed search algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Uniform-Cost Search (UCS). These algorithms do not require any domain-specific knowledge and can be applied to explore the search space.

When it comes to tree search or graph search, it is generally preferable to use graph search because it avoids revisiting already explored states and eliminates redundant paths. Graph search builds on top of tree search by maintaining a set of explored states and checking if a state has already been visited before expanding it.

b. Let's use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find an optimal sequence of actions for the 3 × 3 world. The initial state has dirt in the three top squares, and the agent is in the center.

Here's a step-by-step representation of the search process:

1-Start: Initialize the queue with the initial state.
Queue: [([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "")]
(1 indicates dirt, and 0 indicates a clean square)

2-Expand the first state in the queue.

Actions: ["Left", "Right", "Up", "Down", "Suck"]
Successors:
State: ([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "Left")
State: ([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "Right")
State: ([1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "Up")
State: ([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "Down")
State: ([0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "Suck")
3-Add the successors to the queue.
Queue: [([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "Right"),
([1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "Up"),
([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "Down"),
([0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "Suck")]

4-Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the goal state is reached or the queue is empty.

The optimal sequence of actions for the given initial state would depend on the goal state. If the goal state is to have all squares clean, then the optimal sequence would be ["Suck", "Suck", "Suck"].

c. To construct a search agent for the vacuum world and evaluate its performance, we can use the Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) algorithm. This algorithm considers the cost of each action and selects the path with the lowest cost. In this case, we need to define the cost function.

Let's assume the following cost function:

-The cost of each action (Left, Right, Up, Down) is 1.
-The cost of the "Suck" action is 2.
Using the UCS algorithm, the search agent can find the optimal path with the minimum cost while taking into account the search cost (the number of expanded nodes).

To evaluate the agent's performance, we can generate a set of 3 × 3 worlds with a 0.2 probability of dirt in each square. For each world, we measure the search cost (the number of expanded nodes) and the path cost (the sum of action costs).

d. The best search agent, utilizing the UCS algorithm, would likely outperform a simple randomized reflex agent in most cases. The search agent considers the cost of actions and aims to minimize the path cost, while the reflex agent only makes reactive decisions without any consideration of cost or long-term planning.

The search agent would be able to find an optimal path to clean the entire world while minimizing the path cost. In contrast, the reflex agent would only respond to immediate perceptions, sucking dirt when it's present and moving randomly otherwise. The reflex agent's behavior is not goal-oriented and may not lead to an optimal outcome.

e. When the world is enlarged to an n × n grid, the performance of both the search agent and the reflex agent can be influenced.

For the search agent:

-The search space increases exponentially with the grid size, resulting in a larger branching factor and a potentially larger number of nodes to expand.
-The performance of the search agent may deteriorate as the grid size increases due to the increased computational complexity and longer search times.
-However, if the search agent utilizes an efficient algorithm like UCS, it can still find optimal or near-optimal paths if the search space is well-structured.
For the reflex agent:

-The reflex agent's performance may remain relatively stable regardless of the grid size since its behavior is reactive and not influenced by the grid dimensions.
-However, as the grid size increases, the probability of finding dirt in each square may change, affecting the frequency of the "Suck" action.
-The reflex agent's performance may suffer if there is a higher density of dirt in larger grids, as it would have a higher chance of moving randomly instead of sucking dirt.

4.12: 
Suppose that an agent is in a 3 × 3 maze environment like the one shown in Figure 4.19. The agent knows that its initial location is (1,1), that the goal is at (3,3), and that the
actions Up, Down, Left, Right have their usual effects unless blocked by a wall. The agent
does not know where the internal walls are. In any given state, the agent perceives the set of
legal actions; it can also tell whether the state is one it has visited before.
a. Explain how this online search problem can be viewed as an offline search in belief-state
space, where the initial belief state includes all possible environment configurations.
How large is the initial belief state? How large is the space of belief states?
b. How many distinct percepts are possible in the initial state?
c. Describe the first few branches of a contingency plan for this problem. How large
(roughly) is the complete plan?
Notice that this contingency plan is a solution for every possible environment fitting the given
description. Therefore, interleaving of search and execution is not strictly necessary even in
unknown environments.

ANS:

a. In this online search problem, the agent does not know the exact configuration of the environment but knows the initial location, the goal location, and the set of legal actions in any given state. To approach this problem as an offline search in belief-state space, the agent can start with an initial belief state that includes all possible environment configurations consistent with the available information.

The initial belief state would be the set of all possible configurations of the maze, considering the walls can be in different positions. In a 3x3 maze, each cell can either be a wall or empty, resulting in 2^9 possible configurations. However, since the agent knows its initial location is (1,1) and the goal is at (3,3), some configurations where these positions are walls can be eliminated. Therefore, the initial belief state would have fewer than 2^9 configurations, but the exact number would depend on the specific walls' positions.

The space of belief states represents all possible belief states the agent can have throughout the search process. Each belief state corresponds to a set of possible environment configurations. As the agent explores the environment, its belief state will be updated based on the observations it makes and the actions it takes. The space of belief states grows exponentially with the number of possible configurations, so in this case, the space of belief states would be smaller than 2^9 but still significant.

b. In the initial state, the agent perceives the set of legal actions and can also tell whether the state is one it has visited before. Since the agent knows its initial location is (1,1), there are four possible legal actions: Up, Down, Left, and Right. However, the agent has not yet visited any state, so there are no distinct percepts in the initial state.

c. A contingency plan for this problem involves specifying a sequence of actions for the agent to take from the initial state to reach the goal state (3,3) in any possible environment consistent with the given description. Here is an example of the first few branches of a contingency plan:

1-Move Right: This branch represents the agent taking the action "Right" from the initial state. It leads to a new state (1,2).

-Move Down: If the agent encounters a wall in (1,2), it cannot move down and will stay in the same state (1,2).
-Move Up: If the agent encounters a wall in (1,2), it cannot move up and will stay in the same state (1,2).
-Move Left: If the agent encounters a wall in (1,2), it cannot move left and will stay in the same state (1,2).
-Move Right: If the agent reaches an unvisited state (2,2), it can continue exploring from there.
2-Move Down: This branch represents the agent taking the action "Down" from the initial state. It leads to a new state (2,1).

-Move Right: If the agent encounters a wall in (2,1), it cannot move right and will stay in the same state (2,1).
-Move Up: If the agent reaches an unvisited state (2,2), it can continue exploring from there.
-Move Down: If the agent encounters a wall in (2,1), it cannot move down and will stay in the same state (2,1).
-Move Left: If the agent encounters a wall in (2,1), it cannot move left and will stay in the same state (2,1).
The complete plan would have multiple branches, representing different sequences of actions the agent can take in various possible environments. The size of the complete plan would depend on the number of possible configurations and the complexity of the maze. In this case, since the maze is 3x3 and the agent has limited information, the complete plan would be relatively small compared to the total number of possible configurations.

7.1: 
Suppose the agent has progressed to the point shown in Figure 7.4(a), page 239, having
perceived nothing in [1,1], a breeze in [2,1], and a stench in [1,2], and is now concerned with
the contents of [1,3], [2,2], and [3,1]. Each of these can contain a pit, and at most one can
contain a wumpus. Following the example of Figure 7.5, construct the set of possible worlds.
(You should find 32 of them.) Mark the worlds in which the KB is true and those in which each of the following sentences is true:
α2 = “There is no pit in [2,2].”
α3 = “There is a wumpus in [1,3].”
Hence show that KB |= α2 and KB |= α3.

ANS:
The set of possible worlds for this problem can be constructed as follows:

There are 2 possibilities for each of the three cells: pit or no pit, wumpus or no wumpus.
Since at most one cell can contain a wumpus, there are 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possibilities for the wumpus.
Since the agent has perceived a breeze in [2,1], there are only 2 possibilities for the cell at [2,1]: pit or no pit.
Since the agent has perceived a stench in [1,2], there is only 1 possibility for the cell at [1,2]: wumpus.
This leaves 2 possibilities for the cell at [1,3]: pit or no pit.
Therefore, there are a total of 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 possible worlds.

The KB is true in the worlds where the agent's percepts are consistent with the actual state of the world. In this case, the agent's percepts are consistent with the world being in any of the following states:

No pit in [2,2], no wumpus in [1,3]
No pit in [2,2], wumpus in [1,3]
Pit in [2,2], no wumpus in [1,3]
Pit in [2,2], wumpus in [1,3]
The sentence α2 is true in the worlds where there is no pit in [2,2]. This is true in 2 of the 32 possible worlds.

The sentence α3 is true in the worlds where there is a wumpus in [1,3]. This is true in 1 of the 32 possible worlds.

Therefore, KB |= α2 and KB |= α3.

Here is a table showing the possible worlds, the KB, α2, and α3:

Which of the following are correct?
a. False |= True.
b. True |= False.
c. (A ∧ B) |= (A ⇔ B).
d. A ⇔ B |= A ∨ B.
e. A ⇔ B |= ¬A ∨ B.
f. (A ∧ B) ⇒ C |= (A ⇒ C) ∨ (B ⇒ C).
g. (C ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B)) ≡ ((A ⇒ C) ∧ (B ⇒ C)).
h. (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬C ∨ ¬D ∨ E) |= (A ∨ B).
i. (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬C ∨ ¬D ∨ E) |= (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬D ∨ E).
j. (A ∨ B) ∧ ¬(A ⇒ B) is satisfiable.
k. (A ⇔ B) ∧ (¬A ∨ B) is satisfiable.
l. (A ⇔ B) ⇔ C has the same number of models as (A ⇔ B) for any fixed set of
proposition symbols that includes A, B, C.

ANS:
a. False |= True.
This statement is incorrect. False does not entail True. In other words, False does not imply True.

b. True |= False.
This statement is correct. True does entail False. In other words, if something is definitely true, it cannot be false.

c. (A ∧ B) |= (A ⇔ B).
This statement is incorrect. The formula (A ∧ B) does not entail (A ⇔ B). The two formulas are not equivalent, so the implication does not hold in all cases.

d. A ⇔ B |= A ∨ B.
This statement is correct. The formula A ⇔ B does entail A ∨ B. If A and B have the same truth value, either both true or both false, then A ∨ B will also have that truth value.

e. A ⇔ B |= ¬A ∨ B.
This statement is correct. The formula A ⇔ B does entail ¬A ∨ B. This can be verified by constructing a truth table.

f. (A ∧ B) ⇒ C |= (A ⇒ C) ∨ (B ⇒ C).
This statement is correct. The formula (A ∧ B) ⇒ C does entail (A ⇒ C) ∨ (B ⇒ C). This can be verified by constructing a truth table.

g. (C ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B)) ≡ ((A ⇒ C) ∧ (B ⇒ C)).
This statement is correct. The formula (C ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B)) is equivalent to ((A ⇒ C) ∧ (B ⇒ C)). This can be verified by constructing a truth table.

h. (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬C ∨ ¬D ∨ E) |= (A ∨ B).
This statement is correct. The formula (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬C ∨ ¬D ∨ E) does entail (A ∨ B). This can be verified by constructing a truth table.

i. (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬C ∨ ¬D ∨ E) |= (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬D ∨ E).
This statement is incorrect. The formula (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬C ∨ ¬D ∨ E) does not entail (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬D ∨ E). The right-hand side introduces additional conditions that are not necessarily entailed by the left-hand side.

j. (A ∨ B) ∧ ¬(A ⇒ B) is satisfiable.
This statement is correct. The formula (A ∨ B) ∧ ¬(A ⇒ B) is satisfiable. For example, if A is true and B is false, the formula is satisfied.

k. (A ⇔ B) ∧ (¬A ∨ B) is satisfiable.
This statement is correct. The formula (A ⇔ B) ∧ (¬A ∨ B) is satisfiable. For example, if A is true and B is true, the formula is satisfied.

l. (A ⇔ B) ⇔ C has the same number of models as (A ⇔ B) for any fixed set of proposition symbols that includes A, B, C.
This statement is correct. The formulas (A ⇔ B) ⇔ C and (A ⇔ B) have the same number of models for any fixed set of proposition symbols that includes A, B, and C. The logical equivalence of two formulas means that they have the same truth value in all possible interpretations.

7.10: 
Decide whether each of the following sentences is valid, unsatisfiable, or neither. Verify your decisions using truth tables or the equivalence rules of Figure 7.11 (page 249).
a. Smoke ⇒ Smoke
b. Smoke ⇒ Fire
c. (Smoke ⇒ Fire) ⇒ (¬Smoke ⇒ ¬Fire)
d. Smoke ∨ Fire ∨ ¬Fire
e. ((Smoke ∧ Heat) ⇒ Fire) ⇔ ((Smoke ⇒ Fire) ∨ (Heat ⇒ Fire))
f. (Smoke ⇒ Fire) ⇒ ((Smoke ∧ Heat) ⇒ Fire)
g. Big ∨ Dumb ∨ (Big ⇒ Dumb)

ANS:
. Smoke ⇒ Smoke

This sentence is valid. The implication is true in all cases, since Smoke is always true if Smoke is true.

b. Smoke ⇒ Fire

This sentence is satisfiable, but not valid. The implication is true if Smoke is true or if Fire is true. However, if Smoke is false and Fire is false, the implication is false.

c. (Smoke ⇒ Fire) ⇒ (¬Smoke ⇒ ¬Fire)

This sentence is valid. The implication is true in all cases, since the antecedent of the first implication is the negation of the antecedent of the second implication.

d. Smoke ∨ Fire ∨ ¬Fire

This sentence is valid. The disjunction is true in all cases, since one of the disjuncts must be true.

e. ((Smoke ∧ Heat) ⇒ Fire) ⇔ ((Smoke ⇒ Fire) ∨ (Heat ⇒ Fire))

This sentence is valid. The two implications are equivalent, since the only way for the first implication to be false is if both Smoke and Heat are false, in which case the second implication is also false.

f. (Smoke ⇒ Fire) ⇒ ((Smoke ∧ Heat) ⇒ Fire)

This sentence is valid. The implication is true in all cases, since if Smoke implies Fire, then Smoke and Heat together must also imply Fire.

g. Big ∨ Dumb ∨ (Big ⇒ Dumb)

This sentence is satisfiable, but not valid. The implication is true if Big is true or if Dumb is true. However, if Big is false and Dumb is false, the implication is false.

8.6: 
Which of the following are valid (necessarily true) sentences?
a. (∃x x = x) ⇒ (∀ y ∃z y = z).
b. ∀ x P(x) ∨ ¬P(x).
c. ∀ x Smart(x) ∨ (x = x).

ANS:
a. (∃x x = x) ⇒ (∀ y ∃z y = z)
The sentence states that if there exists an x such that x is equal to itself, then for all y, there exists a z such that y is equal to z.

This sentence is not valid. To see why, let's consider a counterexample: Suppose there exists an x such that x is not equal to itself. In this case, (∃x x = x) would be false, and according to the implication, the whole sentence would be true regardless of the (∀ y ∃z y = z) part. Therefore, the sentence doesn't hold in all cases and is not necessarily true.

b. ∀ x P(x) ∨ ¬P(x)
The sentence states that for all x, either P(x) is true or ¬P(x) is true.

This sentence is valid. It is a logical tautology known as the law of excluded middle. For any statement P, it must either be true or false, so the disjunction (∨) between P(x) and ¬P(x) covers all possibilities.

c. ∀ x Smart(x) ∨ (x = x)
The sentence states that for all x, either Smart(x) is true or x is equal to itself.

This sentence is also valid. Since x is always equal to itself (reflexive property of equality), the second part of the disjunction (x = x) is always true. Therefore, for any x, either Smart(x) is true or (x = x) is true.

In summary:
a. Not valid.
b. Valid.
c. Valid.
